      <p>This is my second semester at OTC, my first semester I took Intro To<br>
      Programming and Technology & Digital Literacy. This semester I'm taking <br>
      Webdev 1 and C# Programming 1. While Webdev isn't what I want to get out of<br>
      college, I am taking it to learn the power of website development.<br>
      In the future I am wanting to also take the remainder of the C# classes and <br>
      possibly a few more webdev classes. After college I do hope to get into <br>
      the career field of software development becuase it is something I really <br>
      enjoy doing.</p>
