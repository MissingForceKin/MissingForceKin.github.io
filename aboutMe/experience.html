    <div class="container">
      <p>While this is my first class for webdev I do have some programming <br>
        experience with other languages. I have taught myself a little of <br>
        other languages to make a few projects.<br></p>
      <p>I have used Python, C#, and Arduino code to do projects in the past. </p>

      <p>This is my most recent project, I used Arduino code on an Arduino Mega 2500 <br>
        to make a laser turret that is controlled by a joystick hooked up to two<br>
        servo motors to be able to precisely manuever the laser to shine where I want.</p>
      <p>My other projects include using Python to reprogram my Amazon Alexa<br>
      using Arduino Code to make a alarm system for my house to detect when someone enters<br>
      or leaves through the front door, using C# to make a decision maker where <br>
      your enter your options that you can't decide on and the program randomly<br>
      chooses one for you. </p>
